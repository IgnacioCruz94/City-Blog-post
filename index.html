    <h1>Minatitlán City</h1>
    <article>
      <h2>Brief history</h2>
      <p>Minatitlán, city and river port, southeastern Veracruz estado (state), south-central Mexico. It is on the Isthmus of Tehuantepec on the Río Coatzacoalcos, 
        20 miles (32 km) from its mouth on the Gulf of Mexico and 210 feet (64 metres) above sea level.</p>
      <p>When founded in 1822 as Paso de la Fabrica, the settlement’s inhabitants included North Americans, French, and Germans. The colony did not prosper until oil was 
        discovered in the vicinity in the 1940s. Now a prosperous petrochemical centre, Minatitlán refines and distributes oil found on the isthmus. Mexico’s first refinery 
        was built in Minatitlán, and there is a network of gas and oil pipelines, the most important of which cross the isthmus to the port of Salina Cruz, on the Gulf 
        of Tehuantepec.</p>
      <p>Lumbering and agriculture are additional sources of income. 
        Minatitlán is accessible by highway, railroad, river, and air.</p>
